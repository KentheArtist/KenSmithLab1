  <h1>Ken Smith and What He's About</h1>
  <p>I'm an illustrator, who has had to work a variety of other jobs<br> 
  through the years to make ends meet. I can get HTML up and running - 
  <br>that's how I did my business website. But that was in 2001.</p>
  
  
  <p>I'm taking Web Development to add to my skill set. Never expected<br> 
  to be taking it at IIT, but thanks to a bicycle accident (<em>on the job</em>)<br>
  and being laid off from my last full-time job, the opportunity arose.</p>
